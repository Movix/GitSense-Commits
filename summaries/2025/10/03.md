# Activity Summary for 10/3/2025

## 10:09:41 AM
The provided log details two entries for the file `/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/ifaktur/core/modules/modIFaktur.class.php`, recorded on 10/3/2025 at 9:18:42 AM and 9:18:49 AM, respectively.

**File-Specific Updates:**
A direct comparison of the code content between these two timestamps reveals no modifications. The file remained identical in both logged states.

**Key Information from the File:**
The file `modIFaktur.class.php` is a core module descriptor for a Dolibarr module named "IFaktur". It outlines the module's configuration and metadata:

*   **Module Identity:** Assigned a unique ID `500000`, with `rights_class` as 'ifaktur', categorized under the "other" family with position '90'.
*   **Version and Authorship:** The module is version '1.0', developed by 'I-Motion SARL' (www.i-faktur.eu). The copyright information spans from 2004 to 2024, including "SuperAdmin" for 2024, indicating recent updates to the copyright notice.
*   **Functionality & Features:**
    *   It defines the module name and description using translation strings `ModuleIFakturName` and `IFakturDescription`.
    *   Uses a Font Awesome icon `fa-file-o` for its visual representation.
    *   Most `module_parts` (triggers, login, substitutions, menus, barcode, models, printing, theme) are explicitly disabled (`0`).
    *   It includes a `hooks` configuration for `adminmodules`.
    *   It requires a temporary directory `/ifaktur/temp`.
    *   Configuration is handled via `setup.php@ifaktur`.
*   **Dependencies and Prerequisites:**
    *   Requires PHP version 7.0 or higher.
    *   Requires Dolibarr version 11.x or higher (`array(11, -3)`).
    *   No external dependencies or conflicts are explicitly listed.
    *   It uses a dedicated language file `ifaktur@ifaktur`.

**Timestamps of Significance:**
While there are two distinct timestamps, 10/3/2025, 9:18:42 AM and 10/3/2025, 9:18:49 AM, they capture the same state of the file, suggesting either a quick succession of file saves without content changes, or a logging artifact. There are no changes observed at these specific times.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The code follows the standard structure for Dolibarr module definitions, extending `DolibarrModules`. It heavily relies on class properties to configure various aspects of the module, such as `numero`, `rights_class`, `family`, `version`, `picto`, and `module_parts`, which is a common pattern for Dolibarr module development. The detailed comments throughout the file, explaining each property, are also a recurring characteristic of this type of module definition. The copyright notice is extensive and updated to the current year (2024 within the log).
