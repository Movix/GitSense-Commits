# Activity Summary for 10/13/2025

## 9:57:29 AM
**File-Specific Updates:**

The only file updated in the log is `/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/public/stripe/ipn.php`. This file is responsible for handling Stripe Instant Payment Notifications (IPN), including receiving webhook payloads, verifying signatures, and processing various Stripe events like `payout.created` and `payout.paid`.

All changes observed are concentrated within a specific `try-catch` block, which is responsible for constructing the Stripe webhook event object using the received payload, signature header, and endpoint secret.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/13/2025, 9:33:52 AM:** Debugging `print` statements were introduced to display the raw `$payload`, `$sig_header`, and `$endpoint_secret`, immediately followed by a `die()` statement. This effectively halted script execution before the Stripe webhook event could be constructed or processed, indicating an initial debugging attempt to inspect input values.
*   **10/13/2025, 9:34:19 AM:** The `print` statements were slightly modified to include descriptive labels ("Payload : ", "Sig Header : ", "EP Secret : "), making the debugging output clearer. The `die()` statement remained in place, still preventing further processing.
*   **10/13/2025, 9:35:09 AM:** The `die()` statement was moved from inside the `try` block to *after* the entire `try-catch` block. This change allowed the `\Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent` method to execute and potentially catch exceptions related to payload or signature verification, while still preventing the rest of the IPN processing logic from running. This indicates a shift in the debugging focus to the `constructEvent` call itself.
*   **10/13/2025, 9:35:24 AM:** A minor formatting change was introduced by adding an extra `print "<br />";` line to the debugging output before the `\Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent` call. The `die()` placement remained the same.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The changes form a clear pattern of iterative debugging. Over a very short period (less than a minute), modifications were made to `print` statements and the strategic placement of a `die()` function call. This indicates an active development or debugging session focused on understanding or troubleshooting the initial reception and validation of Stripe webhook events. The goal appears to be progressively enabling and inspecting different stages of the webhook processing without fully executing the downstream business logic for each IPN call.

## 10:57:33 AM
The `ipn.php` file, located at `/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/public/stripe/ipn.php`, underwent a significant update, as recorded on `10/13/2025, 9:57:55 AM`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Copyright Information**: The copyright notices have been expanded, now covering `2018-2024` and including new contributors, indicating active and continuous development of this component.
*   **Security and Access Configuration**: The file defines several constants (`NOLOGIN`, `NOCSRFCHECK`, `NOIPCHECK`, `NOBROWSERNOTIF`, `DOLENTITY`, `USESUFFIXINLOG`), indicating it serves as a public-facing endpoint for Instant Payment Notifications (IPN) designed to operate without requiring a user to be logged in, while still incorporating various security checks.
*   **Extensive Dolibarr Integration**: It includes numerous core Dolibarr libraries related to administration, users, banking, orders, invoices, companies, and mailing (`main.inc.php`, `user.class.php`, `account.class.php`, `commande.class.php`, `facture.class.php`, `CMailFile.class.php`), along with the Stripe PHP SDK, demonstrating deep integration with the ERP system's functionalities.
*   **Dynamic Webhook Secret Retrieval**: The endpoint dynamically retrieves Stripe webhook secrets (`endpoint_secret`) based on whether the request is for a 'test' or 'live' environment, and whether it's related to Stripe Connect. This allows for flexible configuration and secure validation of incoming Stripe events.
*   **Dedicated User for Actions**: It enforces the use of a predefined Dolibarr user account (`STRIPE_USER_ACCOUNT_FOR_ACTIONS`) for processing IPN actions, ensuring proper permissions and an audit trail for all operations initiated by Stripe webhooks.
*   **Robust Webhook Processing**:
    *   It securely constructs Stripe `Event` objects using `\Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent`, performing signature verification and handling potential errors (invalid payload, signature verification failure, general exceptions) to prevent unauthorized or malformed requests.
    *   A debug logging mechanism is included, allowing the raw payload to be written to a log file if `STRIPE_DEBUG` is enabled.
*   **Multi-entity/Multi-company Support**: The code includes logic to support Dolibarr's multi-company feature by attempting to switch to the correct Dolibarr entity (`$mc->switchEntity`) based on the Stripe Connect account ID found in the event, ensuring that transactions are attributed to the appropriate company.
*   **Automated Payout Handling**: The primary function of this update is to automate the recording and notification of Stripe payout events:
    *   **`payout.created`**: When a payout is scheduled, the system updates a constant (`_NEXTPAYOUT`) with the arrival date and sends an email notification to the configured administrator/societe email address, detailing the scheduled transfer amount and date.
    *   **`payout.paid`**: Upon successful completion of a payout, the system performs an atomic database transaction. It records the payout as a bank transfer within Dolibarr by debiting funds from the Stripe payment bank account and crediting them to the designated bank transfer account. This financial operation is linked within Dolibarr's banking module, and a confirmation email is dispatched.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Reliance on Dolibarr Configuration**: There is a consistent pattern of using `getDolGlobalString()` and `getDolGlobalInt()` to fetch configuration values, making the behavior of the IPN endpoint highly configurable through Dolibarr's system settings.
*   **Error Handling**: A recurring pattern of error handling using `httponly_accessforbidden()` with specific HTTP status codes ensures that security and validation issues are clearly communicated.
*   **Email Notifications**: Sending email notifications is a repeated action for significant events (`payout.created`, `payout.paid`), indicating a focus on keeping administrators informed.
*   **Database Transactions**: The use of `$db->begin()`, `$db->commit()`, and `$db->rollback()` for financial operations (like recording bank transfers) is a strong pattern, ensuring data integrity and atomicity.
