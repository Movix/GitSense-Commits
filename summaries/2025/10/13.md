# Activity Summary for 10/13/2025

## 9:57:29 AM
**File-Specific Updates:**

The only file updated in the log is `/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/public/stripe/ipn.php`. This file is responsible for handling Stripe Instant Payment Notifications (IPN), including receiving webhook payloads, verifying signatures, and processing various Stripe events like `payout.created` and `payout.paid`.

All changes observed are concentrated within a specific `try-catch` block, which is responsible for constructing the Stripe webhook event object using the received payload, signature header, and endpoint secret.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/13/2025, 9:33:52 AM:** Debugging `print` statements were introduced to display the raw `$payload`, `$sig_header`, and `$endpoint_secret`, immediately followed by a `die()` statement. This effectively halted script execution before the Stripe webhook event could be constructed or processed, indicating an initial debugging attempt to inspect input values.
*   **10/13/2025, 9:34:19 AM:** The `print` statements were slightly modified to include descriptive labels ("Payload : ", "Sig Header : ", "EP Secret : "), making the debugging output clearer. The `die()` statement remained in place, still preventing further processing.
*   **10/13/2025, 9:35:09 AM:** The `die()` statement was moved from inside the `try` block to *after* the entire `try-catch` block. This change allowed the `\Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent` method to execute and potentially catch exceptions related to payload or signature verification, while still preventing the rest of the IPN processing logic from running. This indicates a shift in the debugging focus to the `constructEvent` call itself.
*   **10/13/2025, 9:35:24 AM:** A minor formatting change was introduced by adding an extra `print "<br />";` line to the debugging output before the `\Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent` call. The `die()` placement remained the same.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The changes form a clear pattern of iterative debugging. Over a very short period (less than a minute), modifications were made to `print` statements and the strategic placement of a `die()` function call. This indicates an active development or debugging session focused on understanding or troubleshooting the initial reception and validation of Stripe webhook events. The goal appears to be progressively enabling and inspecting different stages of the webhook processing without fully executing the downstream business logic for each IPN call.
