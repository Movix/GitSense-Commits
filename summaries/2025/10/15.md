## 10:34:43 AM
The log details an update to the `/home/admin/.code-workspace.code-workspace` file on **October 15, 2025, at 9:48:00 AM**. This file defines a Visual Studio Code workspace configuration.

The configuration specifies five distinct folders within the workspace:
*   **"01 Master Root"**: Points to the parent directory (`../..`).
*   **"02 Master Admin home"**: Points to the current directory (`.`).
*   **"O3 Master Dolibarr"**: Points to `wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs`, suggesting the main Dolibarr application files.
*   **"04 Master Module SellyourSaas"**: Points to `wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas`, indicating a specific module or project related to "SellyourSaas" within the Dolibarr environment.
*   **"05 Master Dolibarr Documents"**: Points to `wwwroot/dolibarr_documents`, likely for managing Dolibarr's document storage.

The pattern observed is the establishment of a structured workspace for development or administration, specifically around a Dolibarr installation and a custom "SellyourSaas" module, with clear separation of root, home, application, module, and document folders. The settings object within the workspace is currently empty.
