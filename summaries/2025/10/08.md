# Activity Summary for 10/8/2025

## 9:29:09 AM
The provided log details changes related to a custom Dolibarr module named "IFaktur," primarily focusing on its module descriptor and a class for handling various actions and hooks. All modifications occurred on October 8, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/ifaktur/core/modules/modIFaktur.class.php`**
    *   **Timestamp 10/8/2025, 9:11:40 AM:** This entry defines the initial structure and metadata for the `modIFaktur` module. It sets module properties like `numero` (ID 407002), `rights_class` (`ifaktur`), `family` (`I-Faktur`), `editor_name` (`I-Motion SARL`), and `version` (`1.0`). It specifies the module's `picto` as `fa-file-o` and enables `substitutions` within `module_parts`. Key hooks enabled are `adminmodules`, `odtgeneration`, `invoicecard`, `propalcard`, and `shipmentcard`. At this point, the module is set to be visible (`$this->hidden = false;`).
    *   **Timestamp 10/8/2025, 9:16:54 AM:** A minor but significant change was introduced. The `hidden` property of the module was updated from `false` to `true` (`$this->hidden = true;`). This action makes the "IFaktur" module invisible within the Dolibarr module list, likely indicating it's intended to be a backend-only module or temporarily hidden.

2.  **`/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/ifaktur/class/actions_ifaktur.class.php`**
    *   **Timestamp 10/8/2025, 9:15:38 AM:** This file introduces the `ActionsIFAKTUR` class, which extends `CommonHookActions` and provides custom functionalities through Dolibarr's hook system.
        *   The `doActions` method includes logic to prevent the "modIFaktur" module from being disabled when a "reset" action is performed on the `admin/modules.php` page, by redirecting and exiting.
        *   The `formBuilddocOptions` method adds a new option, "Hide Descriptions," as a checkbox (`ifaktur_disable_line_desc`) to document generation forms for invoices, proposals, and delivery notes. The state of this checkbox is managed in the user's session.
        *   The `afterODTCreation` method is a critical hook that modifies the filename of generated ODT documents. It dynamically constructs a new filename based on the document type (invoice, credit note, deposit, proposal, shipment), appending translated identifiers (e.g., "-CreditNote"), the company name, and the document reference. Crucially, if the "Hide Descriptions" option was selected, it appends "_FileNoDescriptions" to the filename before renaming the generated file. This ensures ODT files are named descriptively and can reflect content choices.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The timestamps are clustered within a short period on October 8, 2025, suggesting a focused development, deployment, or configuration session:
*   **9:11:40 AM:** Initial definition of the "IFaktur" module.
*   **9:15:38 AM:** Introduction of the `ActionsIFAKTUR` class with custom logic for module protection, UI options, and dynamic ODT filename generation. This is the most feature-rich addition.
*   **9:16:54 AM:** Modification to hide the "IFaktur" module from the Dolibarr interface.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and License:** All files include a standard GNU General Public License v3 header, with "SuperAdmin" added as a copyright holder for 2024.
*   **Module Naming:** All paths and class names consistently use "ifaktur" (or "I-Faktur") indicating a unified custom module.
*   **Dolibarr Integration:** The code heavily relies on Dolibarr's core structure, including `DolibarrModules.class.php`, `commonhookactions.class.php`, global variables (`$db`, `$langs`, `$conf`, `$user`), and specific Dolibarr object types (`Facture`, `Propal`, `Expedition`).
*   **Internationalization:** The module uses `$langs->load("ifaktur@ifaktur")` and `$langs->trans()` extensively for multi-language support in labels and generated filenames.
*   **Document Generation Customization:** A strong pattern is the module's focus on enhancing the document generation process, specifically ODT files, by adding user options and customizing output filenames. This suggests the "IFaktur" module aims to provide more control and clarity over generated business documents within Dolibarr.
