# Activity Summary for 10/8/2025

## 9:29:09 AM
The provided log details changes related to a custom Dolibarr module named "IFaktur," primarily focusing on its module descriptor and a class for handling various actions and hooks. All modifications occurred on October 8, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/ifaktur/core/modules/modIFaktur.class.php`**
    *   **Timestamp 10/8/2025, 9:11:40 AM:** This entry defines the initial structure and metadata for the `modIFaktur` module. It sets module properties like `numero` (ID 407002), `rights_class` (`ifaktur`), `family` (`I-Faktur`), `editor_name` (`I-Motion SARL`), and `version` (`1.0`). It specifies the module's `picto` as `fa-file-o` and enables `substitutions` within `module_parts`. Key hooks enabled are `adminmodules`, `odtgeneration`, `invoicecard`, `propalcard`, and `shipmentcard`. At this point, the module is set to be visible (`$this->hidden = false;`).
    *   **Timestamp 10/8/2025, 9:16:54 AM:** A minor but significant change was introduced. The `hidden` property of the module was updated from `false` to `true` (`$this->hidden = true;`). This action makes the "IFaktur" module invisible within the Dolibarr module list, likely indicating it's intended to be a backend-only module or temporarily hidden.

2.  **`/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/ifaktur/class/actions_ifaktur.class.php`**
    *   **Timestamp 10/8/2025, 9:15:38 AM:** This file introduces the `ActionsIFAKTUR` class, which extends `CommonHookActions` and provides custom functionalities through Dolibarr's hook system.
        *   The `doActions` method includes logic to prevent the "modIFaktur" module from being disabled when a "reset" action is performed on the `admin/modules.php` page, by redirecting and exiting.
        *   The `formBuilddocOptions` method adds a new option, "Hide Descriptions," as a checkbox (`ifaktur_disable_line_desc`) to document generation forms for invoices, proposals, and delivery notes. The state of this checkbox is managed in the user's session.
        *   The `afterODTCreation` method is a critical hook that modifies the filename of generated ODT documents. It dynamically constructs a new filename based on the document type (invoice, credit note, deposit, proposal, shipment), appending translated identifiers (e.g., "-CreditNote"), the company name, and the document reference. Crucially, if the "Hide Descriptions" option was selected, it appends "_FileNoDescriptions" to the filename before renaming the generated file. This ensures ODT files are named descriptively and can reflect content choices.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The timestamps are clustered within a short period on October 8, 2025, suggesting a focused development, deployment, or configuration session:
*   **9:11:40 AM:** Initial definition of the "IFaktur" module.
*   **9:15:38 AM:** Introduction of the `ActionsIFAKTUR` class with custom logic for module protection, UI options, and dynamic ODT filename generation. This is the most feature-rich addition.
*   **9:16:54 AM:** Modification to hide the "IFaktur" module from the Dolibarr interface.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and License:** All files include a standard GNU General Public License v3 header, with "SuperAdmin" added as a copyright holder for 2024.
*   **Module Naming:** All paths and class names consistently use "ifaktur" (or "I-Faktur") indicating a unified custom module.
*   **Dolibarr Integration:** The code heavily relies on Dolibarr's core structure, including `DolibarrModules.class.php`, `commonhookactions.class.php`, global variables (`$db`, `$langs`, `$conf`, `$user`), and specific Dolibarr object types (`Facture`, `Propal`, `Expedition`).
*   **Internationalization:** The module uses `$langs->load("ifaktur@ifaktur")` and `$langs->trans()` extensively for multi-language support in labels and generated filenames.
*   **Document Generation Customization:** A strong pattern is the module's focus on enhancing the document generation process, specifically ODT files, by adding user options and customizing output filenames. This suggests the "IFaktur" module aims to provide more control and clarity over generated business documents within Dolibarr.

## 10:29:06 AM
The file `/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/ifaktur/class/actions_ifaktur.class.php` was significantly updated on **October 8, 2025, at 9:44:14 AM**.

This file defines the `ActionsIFAKTUR` class, which extends `CommonHookActions` and serves as a custom hook for the `ifaktur` module within Dolibarr. Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Module Management:** The `doActions` method includes logic to prevent the `modIFaktur` module from being disabled via the `admin/modules.php` interface when a "reset" action is performed, redirecting the user instead.
*   **Document Generation Options:** The `formBuilddocOptions` method introduces a new checkbox option, "Hide Descriptions," specifically for `invoicecard`, `propalcard`, and `deliverycard` contexts. This allows users to control whether line descriptions are included in generated documents.
*   **Post-Generation Document Renaming:** The `afterODTCreation` method implements robust logic for renaming ODT documents immediately after their creation. This renaming process:
    *   Dynamically loads the selected language for translations.
    *   Constructs a new filename by incorporating the translated base name, the document type (e.g., "CreditNote", "Deposit" for invoices), the company name, and the document's reference number.
    *   Appends a suffix like "FileNoDescriptions" to the filename if the "Hide Descriptions" option (introduced by `formBuilddocOptions`) was selected by the user.
    *   Logs the success or failure of the file renaming operation.

Recurring elements across these changes include the extensive use of Dolibarr's hook system to inject custom logic at various stages, and a consistent pattern of loading module-specific translations (`langs->load("ifaktur@ifaktur")`) to support internationalization for new features and dynamic content. The code also demonstrates object-oriented practices common in Dolibarr module development, handling different document types (`Facture`, `Propal`, `Expedition`) within a single hook.

## 12:46:28 PM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/ifaktur/class/actions_ifaktur.class.php`.

**Key Information from Changes:**

*   **File Specific Updates:**
    *   The file contains a PHP class `ActionsIFAKTUR` which extends `CommonHookActions`. This class is designed to integrate custom functionality into Dolibarr using its hook system.
    *   It defines several methods (`__construct`, `getNomUrl`, `doActions`, `formBuilddocOptions`, `afterODTCreation`) that correspond to various Dolibarr hooks.
    *   The `formBuilddocOptions` method adds a new option, "Hide Descriptions," as a checkbox on document generation forms (for invoices, propals, and deliveries). This setting is stored in the user's session.
    *   The `afterODTCreation` method is responsible for renaming generated ODT documents. The new naming convention incorporates:
        *   Translated document types (e.g., "CreditNote," "Deposit").
        *   The company name, sanitized for file paths.
        *   The document reference.
        *   An optional suffix like "FileNoDescriptions" if the "Hide Descriptions" checkbox was selected during generation.
        *   It handles language loading dynamically for translations during document creation.
    *   The `doActions` method includes logic to load module-specific translations and prevent the `modIFaktur` module from being disabled by redirecting the user.

*   **Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
    *   **10/8/2025, 12:05:05 PM:** The initial version of the `ActionsIFAKTUR` class was logged. This version contained the full implementation as described above, including a specific `return 0;` statement within the `doActions` method's conditional block for handling module resets.
    *   **10/8/2025, 12:05:31 PM:** A very minor but distinct update occurred. In the `doActions` method, the `return 0;` statement that was previously present immediately after the `header("Location: ...")` call (when preventing module disabling) was removed. This means the function will now always proceed to `return $error;` at the end of the method, even after a redirect in that specific scenario.

*   **Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
    *   Both entries show the full file content, with only one subtle difference between them, indicating a rapid, almost immediate, correction or refinement.
    *   The code consistently uses Dolibarr's global variables (`$db`, `$langs`, `$conf`, `$user`, `$mysoc`) and helper functions (`GETPOST`, `dol_sanitizeFileName`, `dol_syslog`).
    *   The pattern of using hook methods (`doActions`, `formBuilddocOptions`, `afterODTCreation`) demonstrates a standard approach for extending Dolibarr's functionality.
    *   Language handling and internationalization (`$langs->load`, `$langs->trans`, `Translate` class) are consistently applied for user-facing strings and document naming.
