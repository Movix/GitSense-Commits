# Activity Summary for 9/16/2025

## 4:38:28 PM
The file `/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/git/DBIF/htdocs/filefunc.inc.php` was updated on September 16, 2025, at 3:45:45 PM.  The changes primarily involve updates to the Dolibarr configuration file inclusion logic and error handling.  Specifically, the code now includes improved handling of the `conf/conf.php` file, redirecting to the installation process (`install/index.php`) if it's missing or inaccessible.  The code also features updated  error reporting and stream wrapper disabling logic, designed to enhance security and stability, notably disabling potentially risky stream wrappers unless explicitly allowed by configuration settings (`$dolibarr_main_stream_to_disable` and `$dolibarr_main_stream_do_not_disable`). The version of Dolibarr is explicitly set to 21.0.1.  The code also defines various constants, including syslog constants for different logging levels and Dolibarr-specific constants like `DOL_APPLICATION_TITLE` and `EURO`.  The updated error handling manages cases where the configuration file is missing, gracefully redirecting to the installation page.  Finally, the update shows attention to security by disabling several PHP stream wrappers to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
