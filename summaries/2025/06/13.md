# Activity Summary for 6/13/2025

## 4:13:15 AM
The log shows development activity on a Dolibarr system, specifically focusing on a custom module (`ifaktur`) and its interaction with a GLPI REST API.

On June 13th, 2025, at 3:15 AM, a basic REST API class was created, including a child class tailored for GLPI.  This initial version incorporated core GLPI elements like users, entities, profiles, and groups.

Subsequently, at 3:32 AM, a git error occurred while attempting to update submodules related to `ifaktur` and other custom modules (`facturx`, `totp2fa`).  The error indicated local changes in several `ifaktur` files (including classes, language files, and SQL scripts) conflicted with the attempted update, requiring a commit or stash before proceeding.  This suggests ongoing development and potential merge conflicts within the `ifaktur` module.
