# Activity Summary for 6/13/2025

## 4:13:15 AM
The log shows development activity on a Dolibarr system, specifically focusing on a custom module (`ifaktur`) and its interaction with a GLPI REST API.

On June 13th, 2025, at 3:15 AM, a basic REST API class was created, including a child class tailored for GLPI.  This initial version incorporated core GLPI elements like users, entities, profiles, and groups.

Subsequently, at 3:32 AM, a git error occurred while attempting to update submodules related to `ifaktur` and other custom modules (`facturx`, `totp2fa`).  The error indicated local changes in several `ifaktur` files (including classes, language files, and SQL scripts) conflicted with the attempted update, requiring a commit or stash before proceeding.  This suggests ongoing development and potential merge conflicts within the `ifaktur` module.


## 6:13:26 AM
The commit at 6/13/2025, 5:41:36 AM involved updating language files.  Many new compressed archive files (.tar.zst) were added, including .git, .github, .phan, .tx, build, dev, and doc archives.  A new file `gitcommit.txt` was also added. The most significant change was the modification of numerous language files within the `htdocs/langs` directory.  These modifications affected multiple language codes (gl_ES, he_IL, hi_IN, hr_HR, hu_HU, and likely more based on the truncated log).  Each language code directory contained modifications to numerous `.lang` files covering various aspects of the application (accountancy, admin, agenda, etc.). This suggests a large-scale update or cleanup of the application's multilingual support.
